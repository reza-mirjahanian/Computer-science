# Building Fault-Tolerant Systems

## Understanding Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance means creating systems that continue to function even when components fail. Rather than being reactive, we plan for failure by anticipating breakdowns and implementing recovery measures before problems occur.

## Key Strategies for Fault Tolerance

### Replication, Redundancy, and Failover

**Replication**
- Creating copies of critical data or components
- Example: Cassandra replicates data across multiple nodes in a cluster
- Each piece of data is stored on several nodes for accessibility if one fails

**Redundancy**
- Having additional components that can take over during failures
- Implementation approaches:
  - **Active-Active**: Multiple instances run simultaneously with a load balancer
  - **Active-Passive**: Backup instance remains ready but only activates when primary fails
- Storage systems like RAID demonstrate redundancy:
  - RAID 0: Splits data across disks for performance (no redundancy)
  - RAID 1: Mirrors data across multiple disks (provides redundancy)

**Failover**
- Connects replication and redundancy by switching to standby systems when primary fails
- Requires:
  - Constant system monitoring to detect failures
  - Mechanisms to redirect traffic to backup systems

### Load Balancing

- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers
- Prevents overloading individual servers during high traffic
- Tools include NGINX and HAProxy
- Distribution algorithms range from simple round-robin to advanced methods considering:
  - Server load
  - Server health

### Graceful Degradation

- Ensures critical features continue functioning when complete failure occurs
- Implements strategies like:
  - Throttling non-essential features during heavy load (e.g., temporarily disabling real-time comments on social media)
  - Using circuit breakers to stop requests to failing services
  - Preventing cascading failures across the system

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Essential for effective fault tolerance
- Continuous monitoring tools (like Prometheus) track:
  - CPU usage
  - Error rates
  - Latency
- Visualization tools (like Grafana) create real-time dashboards
- Alert systems (like PagerDuty) send immediate notifications when issues arise

## Real-World Implementation: AWS Example

- Deploy applications across multiple Availability Zones (physically separated data centers)
- Replicate databases across zones using synchronous replication
- Achieve redundancy by deploying applications in each zone
- Implement failover mechanisms to redirect traffic automatically when zones experience issues

## Importance of Fault Tolerance

- Building fault-tolerant systems is an ongoing process
- Requires implementing strategies and continually refining them
- Adds complexity, cost, and development effort
- Essential investment in reliability and user satisfaction
