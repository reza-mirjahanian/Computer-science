# 🚨 **Stop Using Legacy Wallets—Meet ZenGo**  
*MPC-powered, seedless, and actually pleasant to use*

---

## 🔑 **The Old Wallet Dilemma**
| Legacy Wallets | Security ↔ UX Trade-off |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Hardware | Ultra-secure 😎  | Clunky, easy to lose 🙄 |
| Software (MetaMask, etc.) | Smooth 😌  | One seed phrase = **single point of failure** 💣 |

> Result: **billions lost** to lost seeds & phishing.

---

## 🧬 **ZenGo’s Fix: MPC + Multi-Factor**
> **No seed phrase ever created.**

### 1. **Key Creation**
- **Two secret shares** generated via MPC math:
  1. **Device share** – stored in your phone’s secure hardware.
  2. **ZenGo server share** – stored encrypted & fragmented.

> 🔐 **Never combined**; never leave their homes.

### 2. **Signing a Tx**
- Both shares **co-sign** via MPC protocol.
- **Single ECDSA signature** hits the chain—looks like any other tx.

## 🛡️ **Built-in 3-Factor Recovery**
| Factor | Where | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Email** ✉️ | Your inbox | Ownership proof |
| **Recovery file** 📁 | iCloud / Drive | Backup entropy |
| **3D FaceLock** 👤 | Phone camera | Biometric gate |

> Lose your phone? **Download app → scan face → enter email → restore.**
