# 🔒 Zengo Wallet Review

**No Seed Phrase – More Secure than a Hardware Wallet**

---

## 🛡️ Core Security Principles

### 1. **The Problem with Seed Phrases**

* **Single point of failure** → if stolen or lost, assets are gone forever.
* Vulnerabilities:

  * Scam websites tricking users into entering phrases
  * Photos/screenshots of seed phrases stolen
  * Physical theft (wallet recovery phrase written down, later copied)
* 📉 Estimated losses: **\$100B in Bitcoin alone** due to seed phrase mismanagement.

---

### 2. **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)**

* Used by institutions (e.g., Fireblocks, Coinbase, PayPal, Meta).
* Zengo pioneered **consumer MPC wallets** (since 2019).
* **How it works**:

  * 🔑 **Two-of-Two Secret Shares**

    * **Personal Share**: generated on your device (using Secure Enclave / Trusted Execution).
    * **Remote Share**: stored on Zengo servers.
  * Shares are cryptographically linked, secured differently.
  * No single point of failure.
* Result → even if one share is compromised, assets remain safe.

## 🔄 Recovery Without Seed Phrase

### Traditional Recovery

* Relies on seed phrase (vulnerable, not tied to your identity).

### Zengo Recovery → **3FA (Three-Factor Authentication)**

1. **Something you access** → 📧 Email
2. **Something you store** → ☁️ Recovery File

   * Not a private key or secret share
   * Useless if stolen
   * Can be stored in multiple cloud services
3. **Something you are** → 🧑‍🦰 3D FaceLock

   * Liveness biometric scan
   * Encrypted and device-only
   * Protected by a **\$600K bug bounty**

✅ You can add backups (secondary email, multiple cloud locations, trusted FaceLock).
