## 🔐 What Is MPC Technology?

* **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**
  A cryptographic protocol enabling multiple parties to jointly compute a function while keeping individual inputs private.

  * Preserves **confidentiality** through distributed computation
  * Removes reliance on a **single trusted party**—instead, trust is **decentralized**
  * **Data never fully reconstructed** in a single place, enhancing security

---

## 💼 What Are MPC Wallets?

* **MPC wallets** utilize MPC to **split a private key** into multiple encrypted shards held by different parties or devices.
* During signing, these shards **collaboratively generate a valid signature** without ever revealing the entire private key.
* This ensures the private key is never fully reconstructed in any single location—**eliminating single points of failure**.

## ⚙️ How MPC Wallets Work

1. **Key Sharding**
   The wallet divides the private key into multiple encrypted shares, stored across different nodes or devices.

2. **Collaborative Signing**
   When a transaction is initiated, each shard holder computes a **partial signature**. These are combined into a **single, valid signature** without reconstructing the full key.

3. **Threshold Signatures**
   Even if some devices are offline or lost, transactions can be signed as long as enough participants are available—enhancing **fault tolerance**.

## 🌟 Key Benefits of MPC Wallets

| Benefit                       | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enhanced Security**         | No full key exists—an attacker must compromise multiple shares to access funds.    |
| **Higher Privacy**            | Signing is done off-chain, making MPC transactions indistinguishable on-chain.     |
| **Operational Flexibility**   | Easier updates to keyholders; better suited to evolving organizational structures. |
| **Institutional Governance**  | Supports multi-party approval workflows and collaborative control over funds.      |
| **Cross-Chain Compatibility** | Generally protocol-agnostic, compatible with many blockchain networks.             |
| **Resilience**                | Tolerance to device or shard loss ensures continuity in wallet access.             |

## 🏦 Custodial vs. Non-custodial MPC Wallets

### Custodial MPC Wallets

* **Managed by a third-party provider**
* **Pros**

  * User convenience
  * Recovery solutions
  * Additional security services (e.g., audits, fraud detection)
* **Cons**

  * Reduced control and privacy
  * Counterparty risk

### Non-custodial (Self-custody) MPC Wallets

* **Full user control over shards**
* **Pros**

  * Maximum privacy and autonomy
  * No reliance on third parties
* **Cons**

  * Greater responsibility for security
  * Loss of shards often irreversible
  * Steeper learning curve

## ⚖️ MPC vs. Traditional And Multi-Signature Wallets

| Feature             | Traditional Wallets          | Multi-Signature (Multi-sig) Wallets | MPC Wallets                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Key Structure**   | Single private key           | Multiple full private keys (m-of-n) | Single key split into encrypted shares    |
| **Security Risk**   | High—single point of failure | Improved, but still vulnerable      | Very high resilience—no full key exists   |
| **Signing Process** | On-chain single-signature    | Multiple on-chain signatures        | Off-chain collaborative single signature  |
| **Privacy**         | Moderate transparency        | Signer identities exposed on-chain  | Highly private—indistinguishable on-chain |
| **Flexibility**     | Static; limited              | Moderately flexible                 | Highly dynamic (add/remove shares)        |
| **Fees**            | Standard                     | Higher (multiple signatures)        | Lower—single off-chain signature          |
