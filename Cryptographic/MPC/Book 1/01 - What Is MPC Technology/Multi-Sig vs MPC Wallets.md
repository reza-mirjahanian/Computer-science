# 🛡️ Multi-Sig vs. MPC Wallets: A Clear Guide for Institutions

Traditional crypto wallets use a *single private key* — creating a dangerous **single point of failure**. If that key is lost or stolen, funds are gone forever.  
**Multi-Sig** and **MPC wallets** solve this by distributing control — making them essential for institutions.

## 🔑 What Are Single-Signature Wallets?

The simplest type of wallet. One key = total control.

### ⚠️ Key Risks:
- **Single Point of Failure**  
  Lose or leak the key? → *Irreversible loss of funds.*
- **No Shared Access**  
  Can’t delegate control or require approvals. → *Unsuitable for teams or organizations.*

> ✅ Good for individuals with small holdings.  
> ❌ Terrible for institutions needing security and collaboration.

## 🤝 What Is a Multi-Sig Wallet?

Think of it like a **vault with multiple locks**. You need *M-out-of-N* keys to open it.

> Example: `3-of-5` = 3 signatures required from 5 authorized signers.

### 🧩 How It Works:
1. **Address Creation**  
   Generated from *public keys* of all signers.
2. **Transaction Proposal**  
   Details (recipient, amount) are drafted.
3. **Review & Sign**  
   Signers approve or reject.
4. **Authorization**  
   Once `M` signatures are collected → transaction is valid.
5. **Broadcast**  
   Sent to blockchain for final confirmation.

### ⏳ Historical Note:
- First used in Bitcoin (2012) via `P2SH` addresses.
- First multi-sig wallet launched in 2013.

## 🧮 What Is MPC (Multi-Party Computation)?

A cryptographic technique allowing *multiple parties to compute together* — **without revealing their private inputs**.

> 💡 Example: Calculate the *average salary* of a group — without anyone disclosing their own salary.

In wallets, MPC **splits one private key** into *shares* — distributed among participants. The full key is *never* reconstructed in one place.

---

## 🧩 What Are MPC Wallets?

Instead of multiple full keys (like Multi-Sig), MPC wallets split **one private key** into *secret shares*.

> Example: `5-of-9` = 5 shares needed to sign a transaction.

### ✅ Key Advantages:
- **Dynamic Quorum**  
  Change approval rules *without* creating a new wallet.
- **Enhanced Privacy**  
  Only *one signature* appears on-chain. No exposure of other signers or quorum rules.
- **Off-Chain Computation**  
  Heavy lifting happens privately → only final signature hits the blockchain.

---

## 🔄 Similarities Between MPC & Multi-Sig

Despite different tech, they solve the same core problems:

- **Distributed Control**  
  No single person can move funds alone.
- **Resilience to Compromise**  
  Attackers must compromise *multiple* parties — not just one.
- **Trust Minimization**  
  Parties don’t need to fully trust each other — cryptography enforces rules.
- **Customizable Security**  
  Set your own `M-of-N` or threshold rules to match your risk profile.

## ⚠️ Limitations of Multi-Sig Wallets

- **⛓️ Not Blockchain-Agnostic**  
  Works only on chains that natively support it (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). Need *separate wallets* for each chain.
- **⚙️ Operational Rigidity**  
  Hard to change signers or thresholds after setup. Often requires *on-chain migration*.
- **🔍 Transparency = Risk**  
  All signers and quorum rules are *visible on-chain* → potential target for attackers.
- **💸 High Transaction Costs**  
  Every signature and setup step happens *on-chain* → expensive gas fees.

---

## ✅ Benefits of MPC Wallets

- **🌐 Multi-Chain by Design**  
  Works on *any chain* using `ECDSA` or `EdDSA` (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.).
- **🕶️ Superior Privacy**  
  Only final signature is public. No exposure of participants or policies.
- **🪄 Key Recovery Built-In**  
  Lost a share? Recover it — without losing access to funds.
- **⚡ Fast & Cheap Transactions**  
  Off-chain computation → smaller, cheaper, faster on-chain transactions.
