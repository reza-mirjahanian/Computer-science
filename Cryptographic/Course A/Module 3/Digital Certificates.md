### **Digital Certificates Overview**
- **Alternative Names**:
  - Public key certificates
  - Identity certificates

### **Certificate Format (x.509 Standard)**
- Defines the structure and consistency of digital certificates.
- **Version 3 Includes**:
  - Version number
  - Serial number
  - Signature
  - Validation details (issuer, expiration date, fingerprints, hashing algorithm)
  - Subject’s public key
  - Additional metadata (hierarchy, certificate chain)

### **Types of Certificates**
1. **Wildcard Certificates**:
   - Format: `*.domain.com` (e.g., `*.technosurge.com`).
   - **Use Case**: Secures multiple subdomains (e.g., `www.technosurge.com`, `courses.technosurge.com`) with a single certificate.
   - **Requirements**:
     - Same private key must be used across all services.
   - **Drawbacks**:
     - Security risk: Compromise of one server exposes all services.
     - Unsuitable for externally hosted services (private key sharing concerns).

2. **Self-Signed Certificates**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides encryption without identity verification.
   - **Use Case**: Internal devices (e.g., switches, servers) where administrators prioritize encryption over authentication.
   - **Drawbacks**:
     - Triggers browser security warnings ("connection not secure").
     - Risks training users to bypass security alerts (dangerous for end-users).

### **Certificate Lifecycle Management**
1. **Expiration**:
   - Certificates typically expire after ~1 year.
   - **Consequences of Expiry**:
     - Users encounter security warnings.
     - Site accessibility drops if users don’t bypass warnings.
   - **Best Practice**: Renew certificates before expiration.

2. **Revocation**:
   - **Trigger**: Private key compromise (risk of domain impersonation).
   - **Revocation Mechanisms**:
     - **CRL (Certificate Revocation List)**: Offline list of revoked certificates.
     - **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)**: Real-time validation.
   - **Challenge**: Root certificates pre-installed on devices may still validate compromised certificates without revocation checks.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Formats & Standards**: x.509 ensures uniformity in certificate structure.
- **Wildcard Certs**: Convenient but risky for multi-server environments.
- **Self-Signed Certs**: Useful for internal encryption but unsuitable for public-facing services.
- **Lifecycle**: Monitor expiration and revocation to maintain security.
