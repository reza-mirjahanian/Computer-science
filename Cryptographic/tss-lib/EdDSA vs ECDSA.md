**Concise Answer:**  
EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a deterministic, high-performance variant of ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) that uses twisted Edwards curves (e.g., Ed25519), avoids random nonce generation, and provides stronger security guarantees against side-channel and randomness failure attacks.

**Detailed Explanation:**  

In the world of digital signatures, two siblings emerged from the same cryptographic family: **ECDSA** and **EdDSA**. Both rely on **elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)** to provide strong security with small key sizes, but they grow up very differently.

ECDSA, the older sibling, was standardized in the late 1990s and became widely used in protocols like TLS, Bitcoin, and SSH. It works over Weierstrass-form elliptic curves (like NIST P-256). But ECDSA has a critical flaw: it requires a unique, unpredictable **random nonce** for each signature. If that randomness fails—repeats or is predictable—the private key can be extracted from just two signatures. This isn’t theoretical: it led to the **PlayStation 3 hack in 2010**, where Sony reused the nonce, leaking the entire signing key.

Enter **EdDSA**, designed by Daniel J. Bernstein (djb) and others in 2011. Instead of gambling on randomness, EdDSA **eliminates the need for a random nonce entirely** by making the nonce a deterministic function of the private key and the message. This is achieved using a **cryptographic hash function** (like SHA-512) applied to both the key and message, ensuring uniqueness and unpredictability without relying on external entropy.

Moreover, EdDSA uses **twisted Edwards curves**, particularly **Ed25519** (based on Curve25519), which offer faster, more secure arithmetic than traditional Weierstrass curves. The curve’s shape allows complete addition formulas—meaning the same math works for all points, including edge cases like point doubling. This uniformity prevents **side-channel leaks** that could reveal secrets through timing or power analysis.

EdDSA also integrates **key clamping** and **pre-hashing**, enforces **strong twist security**, and resists **malleability attacks**—a problem in ECDSA where signatures can be altered without invalidation, causing interoperability and replay issues in blockchain systems.

Because EdDSA signs are **deterministic**, they are easier to test, verify, and deploy in constrained environments. And because they’re faster and safer, they’ve become the preferred choice in modern systems: OpenSSH, WireGuard, Zcash, and the IETF’s TLS 1.3 standard all support or prefer Ed25519.

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA): A digital signature scheme defined in ANSI X9.62 and FIPS 186-4 that generates signatures using randomized nonces on Weierstrass-form elliptic curves, requiring a secure random number generator to prevent private key exposure due to nonce reuse.

EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm): A deterministic digital signature scheme specified in RFC 8032 that operates on twisted Edwards curves (e.g., Ed25519), uses SHA-512 and secret key-derived nonces, and provides high performance, resistance to side-channel attacks, and immunity to nonce reuse vulnerabilities.

Deterministic Nonce Generation: A method of deriving per-signature nonces as a pseudorandom function of the message and private key, eliminating reliance on external randomness and preventing catastrophic private key leakage under nonce reuse.

Twisted Edwards Curve: A birationally equivalent form of elliptic curve defined by the equation $ ax^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2 $, offering unified addition formulas and efficient, secure scalar multiplication suitable for constant-time implementation.

Signature Malleability: A property in some signature schemes (e.g., ECDSA) where a valid signature can be altered without invalidation, potentially enabling replay attacks or blockchain consensus issues; EdDSA mitigates this by enforcing a canonical signature format.
