The Mermaid error occurs because the `<br>` tag is not properly handled in Mermaid syntax. Mermaid does not support HTML tags like `<br>` for line breaks within node labels. Instead, we can use `\n` for line breaks or separate the text into multiple lines within the node definition. Below, I’ll fix the Mermaid diagrams from the Selection Sort worked examples in the original response, replacing `<br>` with `\n`, and ensure the syntax is correct. I’ll provide the corrected diagrams for both Example 1 and Example 2 under the **Complete Worked Examples** section, as these are the likely sources of the error. All other sections remain unchanged since they don’t involve Mermaid syntax issues.

# Bingo Sort vs. Selection Sort (Corrected Mermaid Diagrams)

## 1. One-line Summary
**Bingo Sort** finds the maximum element in each pass and places it at the end, while **Selection Sort** finds the minimum element and places it at the start; both are used for sorting small arrays or teaching sorting concepts.

## 2. Intuition and Real-world Analogy
Bingo Sort is like picking the tallest person from a group to stand at the end of a line, repeating until sorted. Selection Sort is like choosing the shortest person to stand at the front, building the line from the start.

## 3. Formal Definition and Key Properties
- **Bingo Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that iteratively finds the maximum element in the unsorted portion of an array and places it at the end (sorting in ascending order by placing largest elements last).
- **Selection Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that iteratively finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning (sorting in ascending order by building the sorted prefix).

**Key Properties (Both)**:
- **In-place**: Modify the array directly, using minimal extra space.
- **Not stable**: Equal elements may swap positions (e.g., [3a, 3b] may become [3b, 3a]).
- **Comparison-based**: Use comparisons to determine order.
- **Iterative**: Process the array in passes, reducing the unsorted portion each time.

**Key Differences**:
- **Bingo Sort**: Places the maximum at the end, reducing the unsorted portion from the right.
- **Selection Sort**: Places the minimum at the start, reducing the unsorted portion from the left.

## 4. Required Operations
- **Bingo Sort**:
  - **Find Maximum**: Identifies the largest element and its index in the unsorted portion.
  - **Swap**: Exchanges the maximum with the last element of the unsorted portion.
  - **Iterate**: Repeats for the remaining unsorted elements.
- **Selection Sort**:
  - **Find Minimum**: Identifies the smallest element and its index in the unsorted portion.
  - **Swap**: Exchanges the minimum with the first element of the unsorted portion.
  - **Iterate**: Repeats for the remaining unsorted elements.

## 5. Step-by-step Algorithm Walkthrough
We’ll sort the array `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]` in ascending order using both algorithms.

### Bingo Sort Walkthrough
1. **Find the maximum in the entire array and swap it with the last element.**
   - Scan `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]` to find the largest value (9 at index 4).
   - Swap 9 with the last element (already at index 4, no swap).
   - **State**: `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`
     ```
     | 5 | 2 | 8 | 1 | 9 |
     ```

2. **Reduce unsorted portion to `[5, 2, 8, 1]`, find max, swap with last.**
   - Scan to find max (8 at index 2), swap with last element (1 at index 3).
   - **State**: `[5, 2, 1, 8, 9]`
     ```
     | 5 | 2 | 1 | 8 | 9 |
     ```

3. **Reduce to `[5, 2, 1]`, find max, swap with last.**
   - Scan to find max (5 at index 0), swap with last element (1 at index 2).
   - **State**: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`
     ```
     | 1 | 2 | 5 | 8 | 9 |
     ```

4. **Reduce to `[1, 2]`, find max, swap with last.**
   - Scan to find max (2 at index 1), already at end.
   - **State**: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`
     ```
     | 1 | 2 | 5 | 8 | 9 |
     ```

5. **One element `[1]`, done.**
   - **State**: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`
     ```
     | 1 | 2 | 5 | 8 | 9 |
     ```

### Selection Sort Walkthrough
1. **Find the minimum in the entire array and swap it with the first element.**
   - Scan `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]` to find the smallest value (1 at index 3).
   - Swap 1 with the first element (5 at index 0).
   - **State**: `[1, 2, 8, 5, 9]`
     ```
     | 1 | 2 | 8 | 5 | 9 |
     ```

2. **Reduce unsorted portion to `[2, 8, 5, 9]`, find min, swap with first.**
   - Scan to find min (2 at index 1), already at start.
   - **State**: `[1, 2, 8, 5, 9]`
     ```
     | 1 | 2 | 8 | 5 | 9 |
     ```

3. **Reduce to `[8, 5, 9]`, find min, swap with first.**
   - Scan to find min (5 at index 3), swap with first element (8 at index 2).
   - **State**: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`
     ```
     | 1 | 2 | 5 | 8 | 9 |
     ```

4. **Reduce to `[8, 9]`, find min, swap with first.**
   - Scan to find min (8 at index 3), already at start.
   - **State**: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`
     ```
     | 1 | 2 | 5 | 8 | 9 |
     ```

5. **One element `[9]`, done.**
   - **State**: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`
     ```
     | 1 | 2 | 5 | 8 | 9 |
     ```

## 6. Pseudocode
### Bingo Sort
```
ALGORITHM BingoSort(arr)
    n ← length of arr
    FOR end ← n-1 DOWN TO 1
        max_index ← 0
        FOR i ← 1 TO end
            IF arr[i] > arr[max_index]
                max_index ← i
        SWAP arr[max_index] WITH arr[end]
    RETURN arr
```

### Selection Sort
```
ALGORITHM SelectionSort(arr)
    n ← length of arr
    FOR start ← 0 TO n-2
        min_index ← start
        FOR i ← start+1 TO n-1
            IF arr[i] < arr[min_index]
                min_index ← i
        SWAP arr[min_index] WITH arr[start]
    RETURN arr
```

    for end in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        # Track index of largest element
        max_index = 0
        # Find max in unsorted portion
        for i in range(1, end+1):
            if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
                max_index = i
        # Swap max with last unsorted element

    return arr
```

### Selection Sort

                min_index = i
        arr[start], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[start]
    return arr
```

#### Commented Version for Learners (Python)
```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    # Get array length
    n = len(arr)
    # Loop through each position
    for start in range(n-1):
        # Assume current position has minimum
        min_index = start
        # Find smallest in unsorted portion
        for i in range(start+1, n):
            if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = i
        # Swap minimum with first unsorted element
        arr[start], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[start]
    return arr
```

Step 4: [3, 5, 7, 7] -> Done
```

## 9. Complexity
- **Bingo Sort**:
  - **Time**: 
    - **Best/Average/Worst**: O(n²). Scans the unsorted portion (n, n-1, ..., 1) for the maximum, performing ~n*(n-1)/2 comparisons.
  - **Space**: O(1). Only uses a few variables (max_index, temp for swaps).
  - **Why**: Each pass requires linear comparisons, and there are n-1 passes.
- **Selection Sort**:
  - **Time**: 
    - **Best/Average/Worst**: O(n²). Scans the unsorted portion for the minimum, performing ~n*(n-1)/2 comparisons.
  - **Space**: O(1). Only uses a few variables (min_index, temp for swaps).
  - **Why**: Same comparison structure as Bingo Sort, just in reverse direction.

## 10. Correctness Sketch
- **Bingo Sort**: The invariant is that after each pass, the largest element in the unsorted portion is placed at the end, reducing the unsorted portion by one. This ensures the array is sorted in ascending order after n-1 passes, as each maximum is correctly positioned.
- **Selection Sort**: The invariant is that after each pass, the smallest element in the unsorted portion is placed at the start, growing the sorted prefix by one. After n-1 passes, the entire array is sorted in ascending order, as each minimum is correctly positioned.

## 11. Common Pitfalls, Edge Cases, and Variations
- **Pitfalls**:
  - **Bingo Sort**: Incorrectly setting the loop range (e.g., not reducing end) can cause wrong swaps.
  - **Selection Sort**: Forgetting to update min_index properly can place incorrect elements.
  - **Both**: Not handling equal elements carefully (though correctness isn’t affected).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Empty array**: Return empty array.
  - **Single element**: Already sorted.
  - **All elements equal**: Full comparisons performed, minimal/no swaps.
- **Variations/Optimizations**:
  - **Bidirectional Variant**: For both, find max and min in one pass to place at both ends, slightly reducing comparisons.
  - **Use Case**: Both are best for small arrays (n < 50) due to O(n²) complexity; use Quick Sort for larger datasets.

## 12. Practice Problems

### Easy: Sort `[6, 3, 4, 1]` Using Both Algorithms
- **Bingo Sort**:
  - Step 1: Max (6 at 0), swap with 3 → `[1, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Step 2: Max (4 at 2), no swap → `[1, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Step 3: Max (3 at 1), no swap → `[1, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Step 4: Done → `[1, 3, 4, 6]`
- **Selection Sort**:
  - Step 1: Min (1 at 3), swap with 0 → `[1, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Step 2: Min (3 at 1), no swap → `[1, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Step 3: Min (4 at 2), no swap → `[1, 3, 4, 6]`
  - Step 4: Done → `[1, 3, 4, 6]`

### Medium: Modify Both to Sort in Descending Order
- **Bingo Sort (Descending)**:
  - Change to find *minimum* and place at end.
  ```python
  def bingo_sort_descending(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for end in range(n-1, 0, -1):
          min_index = 0
          for i in range(1, end+1):
              if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:
                  min_index = i
          arr[min_index], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[min_index]
      return arr
  ```
- **Selection Sort (Descending)**:
  - Change to find *maximum* and place at start.
  ```python
  def selection_sort_descending(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for start in range(n-1):
          max_index = start
          for i in range(start+1, n):
              if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
                  max_index = i
          arr[start], arr[max_index] = arr[max_index], arr[start]
      return arr
  ```

## 13. Cheat-sheet and Recommended Next Topics
- **Cheat-sheet**:
  - **Bingo Sort**: Finds max, places at end, O(n²) time, O(1) space, not stable.
  - **Selection Sort**: Finds min, places at start, O(n²) time, O(1) space, not stable.
  - Both are in-place, best for small arrays or teaching.
  - Bingo Sort builds from end, Selection Sort from start.
- **Recommended Next Topics**:
  - Bubble Sort (another simple O(n²) algorithm).
  - Quick Sort (faster O(n log n) for larger datasets).
