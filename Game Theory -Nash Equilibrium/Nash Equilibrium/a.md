> **Nash Equilibrium** is a situation in a game where *no player can benefit by changing their own strategy*, as long as the other players keep their strategies the same.

In other words, everyoneâ€™s strategy is *stable* â€” nobody wants to change what theyâ€™re doing.

Letâ€™s use a simple example:

ðŸŽ¯ **Example â€“ The Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma**

Two suspects are arrested. Each can either:

* **Cooperate (stay silent)**
* **Defect (betray the other)**

If both cooperate â†’ they each get 1 year in jail.
If one defects and the other cooperates â†’ the defector goes free, and the cooperator gets 3 years.
If both defect â†’ they each get 2 years.

ðŸ‘‰ The **Nash Equilibrium** is when *both defect*.
Because if either prisoner changes their decision while the other keeps defecting, they wonâ€™t do better â€” so neither has an incentive to change.
