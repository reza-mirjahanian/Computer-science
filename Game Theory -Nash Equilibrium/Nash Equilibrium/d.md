### 🎯 What is Nash Equilibrium?

**Nash Equilibrium** is a concept from **game theory** (the study of strategic decision-making). It describes a situation where:

> **No player can benefit by changing their own strategy—*if everyone else keeps theirs the same*.**

In other words:  
Everyone is doing the best they can **given what the others are doing**, and **no one wants to change** their choice alone.

It’s named after **John Nash**, the mathematician featured in the movie *A Beautiful Mind*.

### 🧠 Key Idea: "Best Response"

Each person picks a strategy that’s the **best response** to what others are doing.  
If everyone is doing that—and no one has a reason to switch—you’ve got a Nash Equilibrium.

### ✅ Simple Example 1: Traffic Light Game

Imagine two drivers approach an intersection at the same time.

- **Options**: Go or Stop.
- If both **Go** → crash! (Bad for both)
- If both **Stop** → wait forever (annoying, but safe)
- If one **Goes** and the other **Stops** → the goer moves ahead, the stopper waits.

Now suppose there’s a **traffic light**:
- Driver A sees **Green** → goes
- Driver B sees **Red** → stops

**Is this a Nash Equilibrium?**  
- Driver A: If B is stopping, A’s best move is to go. ✔️  
- Driver B: If A is going, B’s best move is to stop (to avoid crash). ✔️  

Neither wants to change *on their own*. So **yes—this is a Nash Equilibrium**.

### ✅ Example 2: The Prisoner’s Dilemma (Classic!)

Two suspects are arrested. Police separate them and offer a deal:

|                     | **Prisoner B: Silent** | **Prisoner B: Betrays** |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Prisoner A: Silent** | Both get 1 year         | A gets 3 years, B goes free |
| **Prisoner A: Betrays** | A goes free, B gets 3 years | Both get 2 years          |

Now, what’s the Nash Equilibrium?

- If B stays silent, A’s best move is to **betray** (go free vs. 1 year).
- If B betrays, A’s best move is still to **betray** (2 years vs. 3 years).

Same logic for B.

So **both betraying** is the only outcome where **neither can do better by changing alone**.

➡️ **(Betray, Betray)** is the Nash Equilibrium—even though both would be better off if they both stayed silent!

> 💡 This shows: Nash Equilibrium isn’t always the *best* outcome for everyone—just the *stable* one.

### ✅ Example 3: Choosing a Restaurant

You and a friend want to eat out.

- You prefer **Pizza Place**.
- Your friend prefers **Burger Joint**.
- But **both of you hate eating alone**.

Options:
- Both go to Pizza → You happy, friend okay.
- Both go to Burger → Friend happy, you okay.
- You split up → Both unhappy.

Possible Nash Equilibria:
1. **Both choose Pizza**  
   → You won’t switch (you like it).  
   → Friend won’t switch alone (would eat alone → worse).  
   ✔️ Nash Equilibrium.

2. **Both choose Burger**  
   → Same logic.  
   ✔️ Also a Nash Equilibrium.

So this game has **two Nash Equilibria**!

> 🌟 Nash Equilibrium doesn’t have to be unique.

### ❌ What’s *NOT* a Nash Equilibrium?

Back to the Prisoner’s Dilemma:  
**(Silent, Silent)** is *not* a Nash Equilibrium—because each prisoner can **improve their outcome by betraying** while the other stays silent.

So they’d both be tempted to switch → not stable.

---

### 🧩 Real-World Applications

- **Business**: Competing companies choosing prices (e.g., if both charge low, neither wants to raise price alone).
- **Politics**: Countries deciding whether to arm or disarm.
- **Everyday life**: Choosing which side of the road to drive on—everyone driving on the right (in the U.S.) is a Nash Equilibrium!

---

### 🔁 Quick Summary

- Nash Equilibrium = **Stable outcome** where **no one gains by changing alone**.
- It’s about **individual incentives**, not group benefit.
- There can be **one, many, or even no** pure-strategy Nash Equilibria.
- People can be “stuck” in a bad equilibrium (like in the Prisoner’s Dilemma).
