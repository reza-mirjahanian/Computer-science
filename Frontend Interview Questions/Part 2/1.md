Question 1: What are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how are they used for authentication in a modern web application?

-   Definition: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to authenticate a client with a backend service.

-   Process:
    -   Client sends a request to access privileged resources, including a JWT in the Authorization header.

    -   Backend verifies the JWT with an Identity Server (third-party, maintained or purchased).

    -   If verified, the backend returns the requested resources.

-   Obtaining a JWT:
    -   Client redirects the user to the Identity Server.

    -   User authenticates with credentials (e.g., email/password or multi-factor authentication).

    -   Identity Server issues a JWT, which the client uses for subsequent backend requests.

-   Security Considerations:
    -   Avoid JavaScript access to JWT: Storing JWT in local storage risks cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers could read the token and impersonate the user.

    -   Best Practice: Store JWT in an HTTP-only cookie to prevent JavaScript access.

    -   To retrieve user information, the client requests the backend, which reads the JWT from the cookie and returns the data.

Question 2: What is the difference between storing a JWT in an HTTP-only cookie, local storage, or other methods?

-   Storage Options:
    -   Cookies:
        -   HTTP-only cookies are inaccessible to JavaScript, enhancing security.

        -   Can be set as HTTPS-only for additional protection.

        -   Automatically included in requests, allowing seamless backend communication.

    -   Local Storage:
        -   Accessible to JavaScript, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

        -   A malicious script (e.g., via a Chrome extension) could steal the JWT.

    -   Session Storage:
        -   Cleared when the browser window closes, requiring re-authentication.

        -   Not persistent enough for most applications.

-   Best Practice:
    -   Use HTTP-only cookies to secure JWTs and prevent client-side access.

    -   Cookies ensure secure, automatic inclusion in requests without exposing the token to front-end scripts.

Question 3: What tools would you use to monitor a front-end application, and what metrics would you focus on for an e-commerce use case?

-   Tools:
    -   Sentry: Monitors client-side errors and exceptions.
        -   Provides stack traces, device/OS details, and alerts for on-call teams.

    -   Google Analytics: Tracks usage and traffic analytics.
        -   Industry standard, easy to implement, but not the most advanced.

-   Metrics:
    -   Error Monitoring:
        -   Capture exceptions to ensure quick resolution.

        -   Critical for maintaining application reliability.

    -   Performance Metrics (Core Web Vitals):
        -   First Contentful Paint (FCP): Measures initial page load time.

        -   Speed Index: Evaluates how quickly content is displayed.

        -   Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Tracks visual stability.

        -   Ensures fast loading and a healthy user experience, critical for SEO and e-commerce.

    -   Server-Side Metrics (if server-side rendering):
        -   Monitor APU metrics (CPU, memory).

        -   Track request volume and average response time.

-   Use Case Focus:
    -   For e-commerce, prioritize performance (fast loading for product/catalog pages) and SEO (Core Web Vitals).

    -   Combine error monitoring, performance tracking, and analytics for comprehensive coverage.

Question 4: Can you explain the Shadow DOM, and when and why would you use it?

-   Definition: The Shadow DOM is a subsection of the DOM that encapsulates CSS and markup, isolating it from the rest of the document.

-   Advantages:
    -   Encapsulation and Isolation: Prevents CSS class conflicts in large applications.

    -   Ideal for building reusable component libraries to avoid global style interference.

    -   Ensures consistent appearance across browsers by overriding native styles (e.g., for dropdown components).

-   Drawbacks:
    -   Complexity: Adds development and maintenance overhead.

    -   Performance: Increases browser rendering workload.

    -   Compatibility: Not supported in older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer) and cannot be polyfilled.

    -   Requires developers to define all styles manually, as native browser styles are not inherited.

-   Use Cases:
    -   Best for component libraries or open-source UI components requiring style consistency.

    -   Less practical for day-to-day production applications due to complexity and performance costs.

-   Alternatives for Micro-Frontends:
    -   CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules: Module bundlers hash or prefix CSS classes to avoid conflicts.
        -   Simpler and more performant than Shadow DOM.

        -   Sufficient for most applications without over-engineering.

Question 5: In the context of server-side rendering, what is hydration, and how would you avoid issues with mismatched content?

-   Definition: Hydration is the process of attaching JavaScript event handlers and the virtual DOM to server-rendered HTML, making the page interactive.
    -   Occurs after the server delivers static HTML to the client.

    -   Frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte handle hydration automatically.

-   Challenges:
    -   Without hydration, the page is visible but non-interactive, leading to poor user experience (e.g., "click rage").

-   Avoiding Mismatched Content:
    -   Avoid Dynamic Values on Server:
        -   Example: Timestamps generated on the server may differ from the client, causing mismatches.

        -   Solution: Generate dynamic values (e.g., timestamps) client-side using hooks like React's useEffect.

    -   Ensure Identical HTML:
        -   Server and client HTML must match to prevent hydration errors.

        -   Frameworks like Next.js handle this automatically but require careful implementation.

    -   Use Framework Features:
        -   Modern frameworks provide hydration warnings to diagnose issues.

        -   Developers should monitor these warnings and test for consistency.

Question 6: How would you deploy a front-end application, considering scalability and traffic spikes for an e-commerce use case?

-   Client-Side Only Application:
    -   Static Deployment:
        -   Host static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in blob storage (e.g., Amazon S3).

        -   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like AWS CloudFront to distribute content to edge locations worldwide, reducing latency.

    -   Scalability:
        -   Static files scale easily with blob storage and CDNs.

        -   Handles traffic spikes (e.g., from TV commercials) by leveraging edge caching.

-   Server-Side Rendered (SSR) Application:
    -   Compute Requirements:
        -   Requires a server to render HTML dynamically.

        -   Options:
            -   Modern Platforms: Vercel or Netlify for one-click, distributed compute deployments.

            -   Traditional Cloud:
                -   Use EC2 instances with a load balancer for scalability.

                -   Containerized deployments (e.g., AWS Fargate) for flexibility.

                -   Avoid Lambda functions due to cold start latency, unsuitable for e-commerce.

    -   Static Assets:
        -   Continue using S3 and CloudFront for static assets (e.g., images, CSS).

    -   Scalability Considerations:
        -   SSR adds complexity due to compute requirements and potential latency for global users.

        -   Distributed compute (e.g., Vercel) mitigates latency by deploying servers closer to users.

        -   Use auto-scaling EC2 instances or containers to handle traffic spikes.

-   E-commerce Focus:
    -   Prioritize low latency and high availability for product pages.

    -   Ensure infrastructure can scale rapidly for sudden traffic surges.

Question 7: Can you provide an example of a tricky production bug you fixed and how you addressed it?

-   Bug Description:
    -   A widget component for instant quotes in a complex heating system displayed inconsistent prices across browsers.

    -   Same inputs produced different prices in Safari/Chrome (consistent) vs. Firefox (different).

-   Root Cause:
    -   A developer relied on the order of elements in an array for pricing calculations.
        -   Assumed the second element was always a specific price.

    -   Firefox's default array sorting differed in some versions, causing incorrect pricing.

-   Resolution:
    -   Debugged for three days, analyzing client-side data and reproducing the issue.

    -   Identified the array order discrepancy as the cause.

    -   Refactored the code to use a key-value pair in an object instead of relying on array order, ensuring consistent access to pricing data.

-   Lessons Learned:
    -   Avoid relying on array order for critical computations.

    -   Use explicit data structures (e.g., objects) for reliability.

    -   Highlights the challenge of supporting multiple browsers and versions in front-end development.

    -   Emphasizes the importance of preparing stories about production bugs for interviews to demonstrate problem-solving skills.
