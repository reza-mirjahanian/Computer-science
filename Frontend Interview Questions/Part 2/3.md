### **Senior Frontend Interview Questions Breakdown**  

#### **1. Tooling (Webpack)**  
**Question:** *Can you tell me about your experience using Webpack? What is it used for?*  
- **Webpack** is a **module bundler**.  
- Used to bundle multiple JavaScript files into a single file.  
- Solves the issue of adding multiple `<script>` tags for each JS file in large applications.  
- Parses imports/exports and combines files into a single bundle.  
- Allows applying optimizations.  

**Question:** *Are you familiar with the term **tree shaking**?*  
- **Tree shaking** eliminates unused code/modules in production.  
- Reduces bundle size for better performance.  
- Works **only with ES6 static imports** (`import`).  
- **Does not work** with CommonJS (`require`) because they are dynamic.  

**Question:** *What is a **dependency graph** in Webpack?*  
- Webpack builds a dependency graph starting from the **entry point**.  
- Traverses all `import` statements to form a tree structure.  
- Used to determine which modules are needed for production.

#### **2. CSS-in-JS**  
**Question:** *What is CSS-in-JS? Can you give an example and use cases?*  
- Allows writing **dynamic CSS** in JavaScript.  
- Useful for state-dependent styling (e.g., changing colors on button click).  
- Webpack extracts and injects styles into the DOM at runtime.  

**Advantages:**  
- Dynamic styling with JavaScript variables.  
- Easier to manage interactive UI changes.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- **No CSS caching** (styles are bundled with JS).  
- Harder to debug (auto-generated hashed class names).  
- **Performance impact**:  
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) due to late CSS application.  
  - Deep component trees in React (e.g., `styled-components`).

#### **3. JavaScript Frameworks (React)**  
**Question:** *What is a **pure component** in React?*  
- **Class components** that avoid re-renders if props don’t change.  
- Replaced by **React.memo** and hooks (automatic memoization).  

**Question:** *What is an **error boundary** component?*  
- Catches errors in child components to prevent full app crashes.  
- Displays fallback UI for the broken part instead.  

**Question:** *Explain the **useEffect** hook. What are its pros and cons?*  
- Used for **side effects** (e.g., API calls, localStorage updates).  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Overuse causes unnecessary re-renders.  
  - Runs **after** render, which may trigger additional updates.  
- **Why can’t `useEffect` use an async callback?**  
  - Must return a **cleanup function**, but async returns a `Promise`.

#### **4. State Management**  
**Question:** *How would you handle state for:*  
- **Backend data:** Component state (or lifted state if shared).  
- **Authentication:** React Context (global access).  
- **User settings:** Reducer pattern (e.g., Redux, `useReducer`) for complex transitions.  

**Question:** *What’s the difference between **essential** and **derived state**?*  
- **Essential state:** Independent (e.g., items in a cart).  
- **Derived state:** Calculated from essential state (e.g., cart total).  

**Question:** *Disadvantages of state in React Context?*  
- **Unnecessary re-renders** for all subscribed components.  
- Solution: Split into multiple contexts to optimize.

#### **5. Testing**  
**Question:** *How would you test a React app with no existing tests?*  
- **Prioritize:**  
  - **E2E tests** for critical user flows (e.g., login, payments).  
  - **Unit tests** for reusable components (e.g., buttons, inputs).  
  - **Integration tests** for key features.  

**Question:** *What is **code coverage**? What’s a good target?*  
- Measures % of code executed during tests.  
- **Frontend:** Aim for **60–70%** (higher can be overkill).  
- **Backend:** **80–90%** (easier to test functionally).  

---  

#### **6. Web Performance**  
**Question:** *What is **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**? Causes of bad FCP?*  
- Time until the first content appears on screen.  
- **Causes of poor FCP:**  
  - Heavy client-side rendering (e.g., large React bundle).  
  - No CDN (slow asset delivery).  
  - Unoptimized CSS/JS blocking rendering.  

**Question:** *How to improve FCP?*  
1. **CDN + caching + compression.**  
2. **Remove unused JS/CSS.**  
3. **Code-splitting** (e.g., `React.lazy`).  

**Question:** *When to use **server-side rendering (SSR)**?*  
- **Use cases:** SEO-sensitive apps (e.g., e-commerce, news).  
- **Avoid if:** App is behind auth (e.g., SaaS tools).  
- **Trade-off:** Adds complexity but improves load speed.
