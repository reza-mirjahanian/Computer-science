**30 front-end interview questions** in just **10 minutes**.

---

### **Question 1**: Is CSS rendered before or after the DOM is constructed in the critical rendering path?
- **Answer**: CSS is rendered **before** the DOM is constructed.
  - CSS is **synchronous**, meaning it must be interpreted before parsing and displaying the DOM.

---

### **Question 2**: Can HTML be rendered incrementally? Can we say the same about CSS?
- **HTML**: Rendered incrementally as it’s being interpreted.
- **CSS**: **No**, CSS is blocking.
  - It must be fully downloaded and parsed before proceeding with the DOM.
  - Reason: CSS operates in a **global namespace**, requiring all rules to be calculated before applying them.

---

### **Question 3**: Which script is interpreted first: `defer` or `async`?
- **Answer**: 
  - **`async`**: Downloaded and interpreted as soon as it's ready (order may vary).
  - **`defer`**: Executed only after the DOM is fully constructed (**`DOMContentLoaded`**).

---

### **Question 4**: If an element has `box-sizing: border-box`, is padding included in the width calculation?
- **Answer**: Yes, the padding is included in the width calculation when `box-sizing` is set to `border-box`.

---

### **Question 5**: Name 3 ways to optimize CSS for better performance.
1. Use the **coverage tool** in the browser to ensure only necessary styles are shipped.
2. Implement **compression and caching** for CSS assets.
3. Use **critical CSS** to load essential styles for the first render and defer the rest.

---

### **Question 6**: What determines the final color of a button with conflicting styles?
- **Answer**: The **ID selector** has the highest specificity. It will override other conflicting rules.

---

### **Question 7**: What are some ways to store data in the browser?
- **Answer**:
  - **Cookies**
  - **Local Storage**
  - **Session Storage**

---

### **Question 8**: Advantage and disadvantage of using closures in JavaScript?
- **Advantage**: Simpler function signatures as closures provide access to local and global scopes.
- **Disadvantage**: High memory usage due to variables retained in the closure, which prevents garbage collection.

---

### **Question 9**: How can we prevent a user from triggering multiple backend calls by pressing a submit button repeatedly?
- **Answer**: Use **debouncing** or **throttling**:
  - For submit buttons, **throttling** is usually more effective.

---

### **Question 10**: What is the order of execution in the event loop?
- **Answer**:
  1. Execute all **synchronous code**.
  2. Add `setTimeout` callbacks to the **macrotask queue**.
  3. Resolve **promises** and execute callbacks in the **microtask queue**.
  4. Resume macrotasks: execute any functions from the event queue.

---

### **Question 11**: What is the time complexity of `Array.sort()` combined with `reduce()`?
- **Answer**: 
  - `Array.sort()`: **O(n log n)**.
  - `reduce()`: **O(n)**.
  - Dominant term: **O(n log n)**.

---

### **Question 12**: Why does a `person` object work as an `employee` in TypeScript?
- **Answer**: **Structural typing**: As long as `person` and `employee` have the same properties, TypeScript treats them as compatible types.

---

### **Question 13**: What do ES6 modules allow that `require` does not?
- **Answer**: 
  - **Static analysis** (improves tree-shaking).
  - Modules are determined at build time, unlike `require` which operates at runtime.

---

### **Question 14**: Explain the `this` keyword in JavaScript.
- **Summary**: It depends on the **context**:
  1. In **global scope**: Refers to the `window` object in browsers.
  2. **Event handler**: Refers to the element that triggered the event.
  3. **Strict mode**: `this` is `undefined` if not explicitly set.
  4. **Object method**: Refers to the object itself.
  5. **Arrow functions**: Inherit `this` from their enclosing scope.

---

### **Question 15**: Describe the steps in an event loop tick.
1. Execute all **synchronous code**.
2. Process the **microtasks queue** (e.g., resolved promises).
3. Repaint the browser.
4. Execute **macrotasks** (e.g., `setTimeout` callbacks).
5. Repeat the loop.

---

### **React Questions**

#### **Question 16**: Rules of hooks in React?
1. Hooks must be called at the **top level** (no nested calls).
2. Only call hooks inside **React components** or custom hooks.

#### **Question 17**: What can class components do that functional components cannot?
- **Answer**: Use **lifecycle methods** like `shouldComponentUpdate`, which gives control over rendering.

---

### **Question 18**: Why can’t async functions be used in `useEffect`?
- **Answer**: 
  - `useEffect` expects a **function** returning nothing or a cleanup function.
  - Async functions return a promise, confusing the cleanup logic.

---

### **Question 19**: What is Concurrent React?
- **Answer**:
  - A new React architecture introduced with React 18.
  - Allows React to pause, prioritize, and resume rendering for a more **responsive UI**.

---

### **Question 20**: What is a fiber in React?
- **Answer**:
  - **Fiber**: A unit of work React uses in its **tree structure** to manage component updates efficiently.
  - Enables pausing, resuming, and prioritization of renders.

---

### **Question 21**: Ways to optimize React re-rendering?
1. Avoid rendering with **React.memo**.
2. Use **useMemo** for memoizing expensive computations.
3. Use **useCallback** for stable function references.

---

### **Question 22**: What is rehydration in React SSR?
- **Answer**: 
  - After the server sends pre-rendered HTML, React attaches event handlers and creates the **virtual DOM** to make the page interactive.

---

### **Question 23**: Ways sibling components can share state?
1. **Lift state up** to a parent component.
2. Share state via **React Context**.
3. Use **state management libraries** like Redux.

---

### **Question 24**: Disadvantages of Global State?
1. Triggers excessive **re-renders**.
2. Creates tight **coupling** between components.
3. **Harder to test**, as components are no longer isolated.

---

### **Question 25**: Disadvantage of using React Context?
- **Answer**:
  - Overuse can lead to excessive **re-renders**.
  - Makes components **harder to maintain** and test independently.

---

### **Question 26**: 5 techniques to speed up a front-end application?
1. Use a **CDN**.
2. Enable **compression** (gzip, Brotli).
3. Implement **caching**.
4. Use **bundle splitting** with lazy loading.
5. **Optimize images** (formats like WebP, compressing).

---

### **Question 27**: What is code splitting?
- **Answer**: Break large JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks loaded **on demand**, reducing upfront load time. Tools like Webpack enable this process.

---

### **Question 28**: Which core web vital is most affected by slow renders?
- **Answer**: 
  - **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Measures the time between user interaction and UI updates.

---

### **Question 29**: Advantages and disadvantages of SSR?
- **Advantages**:
  1. **SEO optimization**: Bots can parse pre-rendered HTML.
  2. **Performance**: Faster first content paint (FCP).
- **Disadvantages**:
  1. Increased **complexity**.
  2. Tight **coupling** of front-end/back-end.
  3. **Framework lock-in** (e.g., Next.js).

---

### **Question 30**: Top challenges of microfrontend architecture?
1. **Visual consistency**: Sharing common styles across microfrontends.
2. **Complexity**: Assembling and managing independent apps.
3. **Shared state**: Managing global states like authentication.
