In the world of distributed systems, ensuring that nodes can agree on a single, consistent state is crucial. Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to achieve this by providing fault tolerance and ensuring that a single leader is elected to coordinate operations.

Itâ€™s designed to be easier to understand than previous algorithms like Paxos while providing strong fault tolerance and leader election capabilities.
